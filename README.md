# EXERCISE #2 - generic dialog component that can be customized with any content

In this step, we want to create a dialog component displayed as an overlay for different use cases.

1. The component can be used as a modal (the user has to close it before being able to interact with the rest of the webpage) or a regular dialog (the user can still interact with the rest of the page)

2. You cannot use any third-party component library for this, though you can use third-party CSS to achieve the modal/dialog overlay effect if needed.

3. The dialog's header, body, and footer could be any HTML/component the user wants. The dialog API should also expose a way to open/close it from another component.

4. Create a sample component that illustrates different use cases of your dialog.
